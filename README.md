# Parietals Break

Literally the best game you will ever play. Parietals Break is a story line, text-based game created on Pygame based on the entirely fictional university named Dotre Name. It's a half-mandatory-project, half-jab-at-sexist-double-standards-at-a-totally-fictional-school-that-isn't-in-Indiana. Have fun!

# Installation
To play, download the .zip and extract the contents or clone the repository by typing
```
https://github.com/agervase/parietalsbreak.git
```
The game requires Pygame installed locally which, if you do not already have, can download at:
```
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
```
or use on your terminal
```
pip install Pygame
```
# How to Play

Parietals Break is a click-based game. Make the best decisions to try to get your boy (or girl) to freedom or risk getting a stern talking to at the Office of Community Standards. 

# Other Fun Stuff

We made this game in about 40 hours. If there's stuff broken, hmu. Also, feel free to use this to up your Pygame/Python game. 
Verilog is a hardware description language.
